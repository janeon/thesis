\ctparttext{Gig workers individually develop several undocumented strategies for improving their earnings and advancing their careers. In the following part, we investigate communication strategies that (a large set of) workers used on a leading online freelancing platform, observing how such patterns of practice correlated with chances of success at multiple stages of their projects and careers.}

\ctparttext{While workers can individually develop strategies to advance their careers, such techniques do not contribute to the large-scale infrastructural changes necessary for improving gig work conditions. In the following, we collaborate with multiple stakeholder groups to explore possible interventions to improve gig work conditions across platforms and domains, revealing the promise of individualized policy and regulations, as well as technological advances to support worker collectivism.}

\ctparttext{Several factors impede progress on furthered regulations and policymaking of the gig economy, including an absence of unified worker communities and the lack of access to work data that document existing labor conditions. In this third part, we design, develop and deploy a tool that support workers in forming collective communities, share information to each other and supporting stakeholders (e.g., advocates, union organizers, policymakers), and eventually leverage this collective data to influence more effective policy decisions.}
\part{Cross-platform Datasharing to Advance Peer Support \& Policy}\label{part3}
\include{Chapters/Chapter05}
\include{Chapters/Chapter6}
\ctparttext{Breaking technological barriers between workers play an important role in unifying them toward common goals such as financial well-being and policy advocacy. But the power and bandwidth of workers alone 
is limited, especially when acts of resistance puts their financial and physical well-beings at risk. While Part II explored alternative futures with workers, platform designers and policymakers, this final part turn to gamified interventions as a means to garner consumers support and engagement in the advocacy for gig labor.
