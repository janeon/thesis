    abstract = { Many workers have been drawn to the gig economy by the promise of flexible, autonomous work, but scholars have highlighted how independent working arrangements also come with the drawbacks of precarity. Digital platforms appear to provide an alternative to certain aspects of precarity by helping workers find work consistently and securely. However, these platforms also introduce their own demands and constraints. Drawing on 20 interviews with online freelancers, 19 interviews with corresponding clients and a first-hand walkthrough of the Upwork platform, we identify critical literacies (what we call gig literacies), which are emerging around online freelancing. We find that gig workers must adapt their skills and work strategies in order to leverage platforms creatively and productively, and as a component of their ‘personal holding environment’. This involves not only using the resources provided by the platform effectively, but also negotiating or working around its imposed structures and control mechanisms. }

abstract = {This paper addresses calls for more research on privacy in the gig economy across a range of work platforms. To understand privacy risks, behaviors, and consequences from the perspective of workers, we analyzed workers’ posts about privacy and surveillance from 12 Reddit forums representing four main types of work (crowdwork, freelancing, ridesharing, and delivery). We found that workers perceive both platform companies and customers as sources of unnecessary and opaque data collection and surveillance that can threaten their privacy, safety, and economic outcomes. Workers also engage in many risk mitigation strategies, including self-protective surveillance behaviors such as video recording themselves and customers, as a costly but necessary response to power imbalances created by surveillance. Based on our multi-platform analysis, we present a guiding set of questions that workers, designers, and researchers can use to assess the privacy implications of current and future gig work platforms.},

abstract = {Online freelancer marketplaces offer workers the flexibility and control they desire. However, workers also struggle with the uncertainty resulting from these benefits. In traditional brick-and-mortar workplaces, workers who experience uncertainty during specific phases of their assimilation into a new role or organization engage in information-seeking behaviors. Understanding these phases of heightened uncertainty helps organizations better cater to workers' informational needs e.g. through mentorship programs. While understanding the uncertainty that online workers experience as they assimilate into their career is critical to understanding online workers' needs, such an understanding is currently severely limited. thus, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 online freelancers to investigate critical events that contribute to uncertainty early in their online careers. We situate these critical events within the context of organizational assimilation, and how participants employ diverse information-seeking tactics.},

abstract = {Information asymmetries create extractive, often harmful relationships between platform workers (e.g., Uber or Deliveroo drivers) and their algorithmic managers. Recent HCI studies have put forward more equitable platform designs but leave open questions about the social and technical infrastructures required to support them without the cooperation of platforms. We conducted a participatory design study in which platform workers deconstructed and re-imagined Uber’s schema for driver data. We analyzed the data structures and social institutions participants proposed, focusing on the stakeholders, roles, and strategies for mitigating conflicting interests of privacy, personal agency, and utility. Using critical theory, we reflected on the capability of participatory design to generate bottom-up collective data infrastructures. Based on the plurality of alternative institutions participants produced and their aptitude to navigate data stewardship decisions, we propose user-configurable tools for lightweight data institution building, as an alternative to redesigning existing platforms or delegating control to centralized trusts.},

    abstract = { This article evaluates the job quality of work in the remote gig economy. Such work consists of the remote provision of a wide variety of digital services mediated by online labour platforms. Focusing on workers in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the article draws on semi-structured interviews in six countries (N = 107) and a cross-regional survey (N = 679) to detail the manner in which remote gig work is shaped by platform-based algorithmic control. Despite varying country contexts and types of work, we show that algorithmic control is central to the operation of online labour platforms. Algorithmic management techniques tend to offer workers high levels of flexibility, autonomy, task variety and complexity. However, these mechanisms of control can also result in low pay, social isolation, working unsocial and irregular hours, overwork, sleep deprivation and exhaustion. }

abstract = {{Enterprises in low‐resource contexts often rely on bricolage (i.e., making do by applying resources at hand to new problems). However, bricolage has traditionally been regarded as a way to temporarily get by, potentially constraining growth if continued over time. This has been explained by factors such as limited development of learning competencies. Surprisingly, we encountered a social organization appearing to use bricolage to scale extensively into a variety of locations. This puzzling observation prompted our research question: Can bricolage be scaled, and if so, how and why? We embarked on a process study of this organization, leading to a novel conceptual model of scaling bricolage: as a low‐cost replication process of heuristics, enabling fit with a diversity of local environments, as well as cross‐unit learning. How do organizations emerge, survive, and scale in resource‐scarce environments? Traditional scaling models tend to rely on considerable financial resources and companies often struggle to adjust to diverse contexts. In contrast, we identified and studied an organization in Sub‐Saharan Africa that we argue used simple rules to scale bricolage—making the best out of what is at hand—successfully in diverse low‐resource contexts. Our paper provides a novel conceptual model of scaling bricolage: a low‐cost replication process of heuristics, enabling fit with a diversity of local environments, as well as cross‐unit innovation and learning.}},

We propose the effect of workers’ use of the direct messaging system on employers’ hiring decisions and conceptualize the information role of direct messaging. To empirically evaluate the information role of the direct messaging system, we leverage data on the direct messaging activities between workers and employers across more than 470,000 job applications on a leading online labor market. We report evidence that direct messaging with a prospective employer increases a worker’s probability of being hired by 8.9\%. However, the degree to which workers benefit from direct messaging is heterogeneous, and the effect amplifies for workers approaching employers from a position of disadvantage (lacking tenure or fit with the job) and attenuates as more workers attempt to message the same prospective employer. The effects also depend on message content. In particular, we find that the benefits of direct messaging for workers depend a great deal on the politeness of the workers, and this “politeness effect” depends on several contextual factors. The beneficial effects are amplified for lower-status workers (i.e., workers lacking tenure and job fit) and workers who share a common language with the employer. At the same time, the beneficial effects weaken in the presence of typographical errors. These findings provide important insights into when and what to message to achieve favorable hiring outcomes in online employment settings.}},

abstract = {{Female entrepreneurship is increasingly playing phenomenal roles in the economic growth of many countries. Several businesses employing many people and producing a lot of revenues are created and run by women. Many governments and international bodies are promoting female entrepreneurship fervently especially in developing economies. However, the difficulty that women in resource-constrained economies face in accessing funding to start and grow their businesses makes going into entrepreneurship a wishful dream, thus pointing to low numbers of female ventures in developing countries. However, the phenomenal numbers of female entrepreneurs in certain developing regions such as West Africa present an intriguing situation. This study therefore sought to investigate the funding sources of female entrepreneurs in developing economies and how those sources are combined in funding businesses. Qualitative methods were employed for the study, collecting data through interviews and non-participant observations in two resource-constrained countries of West Africa—Ghana and Ivory Coast. We discovered that women entrepreneurs combined various resources from different sources to start and run businesses. These sources are made possible through their social capital. Prominent sources of funding are gifts/grants from friends, families, and well-wishers; personal savings; and interest-free loans. Few women accessed commercial loans but not until they have grown their businesses up to a certain stage. The study contributes to the social capital and entrepreneurial bricolage theories by extending them to entrepreneurial financing and female entrepreneurship in developing economies. It also adds to the studies questioning the well-publicized salvific role of microfinance in developing countries especially among the poor and vulnerable.}},

abstract = {{Live chat tools have emerged as a channel for fostering synchronous communication between sellers and buyers. The role of live chat in the e-commerce environment, however, is largely underexplored. Using granular data from Alibaba, we examine the effect of live chat on consumers’ purchase decisions. After controlling for the selection process that customers with high purchase intention are more likely to initiate live chat in the first place, we find that live chat can increase purchase probability of tablets by 15.99\%. We also investigate how the effect of live chat is moderated by existing information cues: product sales volume and seller feedback score. The substitutional or complementary patterns allow us to understand how live chat tools change the ways consumers evaluate product quality and seller credibility. We observe a substitutional effect of live chat on seller feedback score such that sellers with low feedback score benefit more from live chat conversations than sellers with high score. On the contrary, products with high past sales volume sell better after live chat, indicating a reinforcement effect. Such findings deepen our understanding of the difference between various information cues in electronic markets. As one of the first systematic studies to investigate live chat, our paper contributes to web trust conceptual frameworks with empirical analyses and sheds light on practical decisions faced by e-vendors and platform designers.}}

Three types of personalization strategies were proposed and operationalized in a simulated banking setting. Evaluations of service encounters that differed in the degree and type of personalization employed indicate that personalization is not a unitary phenomenon and must be approached carefully in the context of service design.}},

These findings suggest that individuals' temporal consistency with themselves may be disrupted if they accommodate to others; advisors may be especially likely to do this.

The pursuit of low-capacity workers is consequential, as these workers are more likely to reject employer inquires, causing a reduction in the probability a job opening is ultimately filled. In an attempt to shift more employer attention to workers with greater capacity, the market-designing platform introduced a new signaling feature into the market. It was effective, in that when a worker signaled having high capacity, he or she received more invitations from employers, rejected a smaller fraction of those invitations, quoted a lower price to do the work, and was more likely to be hired. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the signaling feature alone could increase market surplus by as much as 6\%, both by increasing the number of matches formed and by helping to allocate projects to workers with lower costs.}}

Finally, we highlight the tension between ideal-typical bricolage and general organizational norms and standards, and discuss both the bricoleur’s legitimacy and how a bricolage-based arrangement might be embedded into an organizational context.}},

Using both survey and administrative data, the authors provide the first comprehensive analysis of the labor market for Uber’s driver-partners. Drivers appear to be attracted to the Uber platform largely because of the flexibility it offers, the level of compensation, and the fact that earnings per hour do not vary much based on the number of hours worked. Uber’s driver-partners are more similar in terms of their age and education to the general workforce than to taxi drivers and chauffeurs. Most of Uber’s driver-partners had full- or part-time employment before joining Uber, and many continue in those positions after starting to drive with the Uber platform, which makes the flexibility to set their own hours especially valuable. Drivers often cite the desire to smooth fluctuations in their income as one of their reasons for partnering with Uber. }

In this provocation piece, we debate the obstructions to and potential ways to promote boundaryless careers in the gig economy, which—despite appearing on the surface to offer suitable conditions for boundaryless careers—suffers from numerous conditions that hinder such careers. Thus, boundaryless careers in the gig economy could be an oxymoron. In particular, we conjecture that intraorganisational and interorganisational career boundaries restrict gig workers' development of relevant career competencies and thus limit their mobility. We then put forward the notion that we have to consider moving away from traditional, employer‐centric human resource management and introduce new forms of network‐based and self‐organised human resource management practices (in the form of collaborative communities of practice) in order to diminish these boundaries.}},

               genuinely open, free, and competitive markets can reawaken the
               dormant nineteenth-century spirit of liberal reform and lead to
               greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation.Only by radically
               expanding the scope of markets can we reduce inequality, restore
               robust economic growth, and resolve political conflicts. But to

We use interview and survey data to highlight how platform workers in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are normatively disembedded from social protections through a process of commodification. Normative disembeddedness leaves workers exposed to the vagaries of the external labour market due to an absence of labour regulations and rights. It also endangers social reproduction by limiting access to healthcare and requiring workers to engage in significant unpaid ‘work-for-labour’. However, we show that these workers are also simultaneously embedded within interpersonal networks of trust, which enable the work to be completed despite the low-trust nature of the gig economy. In bringing together the concepts of normative and network embeddedness, we reconnect the two sides of Polanyi’s thinking and demonstrate the value of an integrated understanding of Polanyi’s approach to embeddedness for understanding contemporary economic transformations. }

title={An Uber Ambivalence: Employee Status, Worker Perspectives, \& Regulation in the Gig Economy}, DOI={10.2139/ssrn.3488009}, abstractNote={This article uses ethnographic research on gig worker advocacy groups in California to make sense of an apparent paradox. Extant survey research finds that a majority of Uber/Lyft drivers in the U.S. do not want to be employees. And yet, drivers and gig worker groups aggressively advocated to pass AB5, an internationally heralded bill in California that makes it very likely that they are considered employees under state law. I argue that the paradoxes embodied in the perspectives of workers in my research can be theorized as attitudinal ambivalence. This ambivalence toward employee status was informed both by their relative powerlessness in relation to gig companies and by the uncertainties and insecurities specific to app-based gig work. Overwhelmingly, drivers both wanted employee benefits and feared how the companies might behave as an employer. Rather than re-shape employment laws and restrict worker benefits to accommodate the policy prescriptions of app-enabled gig companies, regulators may use these research findings to expand the benefits available through the traditional employment regime.}, journal={SSRN Electronic Journal}, author={Dubal, Veena }, year={2019} }

However, little work has investigated alternative platform designs to promote worker well-being, particularly from workers’ own perspectives. We use a participatory design approach wherein workers explore their algorithmic imaginaries to co-design interventions that center their lived experiences, preferences, and well-being in algorithmic management. Our interview and participatory design sessions highlight how various design dimensions of algorithmic management, including information asymmetries and unfair, manipulative incentives, hurt worker well-being. Workers generate designs to address these issues while considering competing interests of the platforms, customers, and themselves, such as information translucency, incentives co-configured by workers and platforms, worker-centered data-driven insights for well-being, and collective driver data sharing. Our work offers a case study that responds to a call for designing worker-centered digital work and contributes to emerging literature on algorithmic work.},

               persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI
               interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable
               errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired
               societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex

               AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive

               designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges.

We identified the factors that contributed to drivers' feelings of safety and the strategies they engaged in to protect themselves. We found that drivers relied on methods that were technical, social, and physical, to ensure their safety and engaged in informal collaborative and communicative activities with other drivers inside and outside of the ridesharing system. We discuss implications for future design for ridesharing apps and other location-based computer-supported collaborative systems that have potential safety hazards.},

               surface of the web, lost in our wrong-headed debates about AI, a
               new menace is looming. Anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computer

               can only function smoothly thanks to the judgment and experience
               of a vast, invisible human labor force. These people doing
               ``ghost work'' make the internet seem smart. They perform
               high-tech piecework: flagging X-rated content, proofreading,
               designing engine parts, and much more. An estimated 8 percent of
               Americans have worked at least once in this ``ghost economy,''
               and that number is growing. They usually earn less than legal
               minimums for traditional work, they have no health benefits, and
               they can be fired at any time for any reason, or none. There are
               no labor laws to govern this kind of work, and these latter-day
               assembly lines draw in--and all too often overwork and
               underpay--a surprisingly diverse range of workers: harried young
               mothers, professionals forced into early retirement, recent
               grads who can't get a toehold on the traditional employment
               ladder, and minorities shut out of the jobs they want. Gray and

The rise of large scale labor analytics raises questions about how and whether workers could use such data to advocate for their own goals. Here, we analyze the historical development of workplace technology design methods in CSCW to show how mid-20th century labor responses to scientific management can inform directions in contemporary digital labor advocacy. First, we demonstrate how specific methodological tendencies from industrial scientific management were adapted to work in CSCW, and then subsequently altered in crowd work and social computing research to more closely resemble industrial approaches. Next, we show how three tactics used by labor unions to strategically engage with industrial scientific management in the mid-20th century can inform data-driven worker advocacy in platform-mediated work. Finally, we discuss how this history shapes our understanding of worker participation and the implications of using worker data for contemporary advocacy goals.},

The paper illustrates the argument through the case of Turkopticon, originally an activist tool for workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), built by the authors and maintained since 2009. The paper analyzes public depictions of Turkopticon which cast designers as creative innovators and AMT workers as without agency or capacity to change their situation. We argue that designers' elevated status as workers in knowledge economies can have practical consequences for the politics of their design work. We explain the consequences of this status for Turkopticon and how we adapted our approach in response over the long term. We argue for analyses of power in design work that account for and develop counters to hegemonic beliefs and practices about design as high-status labor.},

abstract = {In order to sustain everyday life in India during pandemic induced lockdowns, home service gig platforms materialized to provide essential services for urban society. As unemployment worsened, these gig platforms also emerged as key sources of paid work for gig workers, with some platforms promising an unusual degree of health and financial support for their gig workforce. Through semi-structured interviews, we examine how women beauty workers engaged with the infrastructural promise extended by home service gig platforms during the pandemic. While gig platforms promoted the potential of stable income and social security in the context of the Global South, we investigate the reality behind this image. We find that various breakdowns, from miscommunication around localized travel restrictions to limited platform helpline access, introduces day-to-day unpredictability for gig workers, hindering access to paid work as well as other platform extended benefits. We suggest that home service gig platforms actually serve as 'faux infrastructure,' in which the privatized logics work to enclose public value, while pushing the burden of access onto gig workers who must perform additional, often unpaid labors, in order to fill last-mile service gaps.},

In this study, we propose that social sensing could address bottlenecks in worker’s awareness, interpretation of the informatics, and subsequent behavioral change. We conducted a four-week technology probe study by recruiting flexible long-hour professional drivers (Taxi and Uber drivers) and their significant others to use a social sensing prototype which collects data from the drivers and shares it with their partners as well as incorporates partners’ observations. We interviewed them before and after the probe study and found that while technological sensing was able to increase drivers’ awareness of their well-being status and intention to modify behaviors. The “social sensing” design was able to further shape such awareness or intention into action, highlighting the potential of using the sociotechnical approach in promoting work-life balance among long-hour workers.},

abstract = {Women gig workers face unique challenges in on-demand platforms as gendered aspects of class, caste, and labor participation intersect with moments of control experienced on the job. Through in-depth interviews with 19 beauty workers on on-demand home service platforms, we explore how the platformization of informal beauty work in India has ruptured dominant socio-cultural structures of control that have traditionally shaped women's mobility and access to work. This paper maps the ways in which women beauty gig workers experience and are impacted by algorithmic and bureaucratic management practices prevalent in the gig economy, in the context of home service platforms in Bangalore. We find that platform control impacts lives in myriad ways, beyond the conditions of work. Women workers negotiate their identities and sense of agency through the visibility afforded by platform control mechanisms. Yet, despite these subversions, being on a platform does not fundamentally change the socio-cultural logic that restricts women's lives in India. These mechanisms work to entrench power asymmetries between customers and workers, as well as maintain them between the platform and the worker.},

abstract = {The growing online gig economy provides ways for women to participate in a flexible, remote workforce and close the offline gender pay and participation gap. While women in online labor marketplaces earn about as much overall as men, women set lower bill rates suggesting gender differences in pricing strategies. In this study, we surveyed 392 freelancers in the United States (US) on the popular marketplace platform, Upwork, to understand strategies used to set hourly bill rates. We did not find gender differences in pricing strategies that were significantly related to bill rate. Instead, we found that other factors, such as full-time freelancer status and level of self-esteem, may help explain gender differences in bill rates. To better support equity and fairness in the growing gig economy, CHI researchers must identify, assess, and address the complex interaction between societal conditions in online labor markets.},

               which complicate the application of traditional labour
               regulations and employment standards. This article reviews the
               extent of this type of work in Australia, and its main
               characteristics. It then considers the applicability of existing
               employment regulations to these `gig' jobs, citing both
               Australian and international legislation and case law. There is
               considerable uncertainty regarding the scope of traditional
               regulations, minimum standards and remedies in the realm of
               irregular digitally mediated work. Regulators and policymakers

               framework governing gig work. The article notes five major
               options in this regard: enforcement of existing laws; clarifying
               or expanding definitions of `employment'; creating a new
               category of `independent worker'; creating rights for `workers',

              forums. The past literature focuses primarily on how gig workers
              for mainstream corporate platforms leverage forums. Yet,
              marginalization, stigma, censorship, and criminalization all
              shape how people, including gig workers, use digital technology.
              In this work, we seek to take a first step toward understanding
              how marginalized, stigmatized, digitally censored, and in some
              cases criminalized gig workers leverage the affordances of online
              public forums to build community and increase their welfare. To
              do so, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 4,000 posts and
              25,851 comments shared over four months in a large online public
              forum used by sex workers for peer support. Sex workers sit at
              the intersection of multiple marginalized communities, and thus
              offer a lens into the broader use of forums by marginalized labor
              communities. Our findings offer insight into how these workers
              use moderation to preserve their safety and community. Further,
              we highlight similarities and differences between how this
              community utilizes the forum platform and prior scholarship on
              the use of online forums by gig workers.",

              redefining the nature of work and contributing to a significant
              change in how contemporary economies are organised. Its expansion
              is not unproblematic. This article provides a clear and
              systematic analysis of the main ethical challenges caused by the
              gig economy. Following a brief overview of the gig economy, its
              scope and scale, we map the key ethical problems that it gives
              rise to, as they are discussed in the relevant literature. We map
              them onto three categories: the new organisation of work (what is
              done), the new nature of work (how it is done), and the new
              status of workers (who does it). We then evaluate a recent
              initiative from the EU that seeks to address the challenges of
              the gig economy. The 2019 report of the European High-Level
              Expert Group on the Impact of the Digital Transformation on EU
              Labour Markets is a positive step in the right direction.
              However, we argue that ethical concerns relating to algorithmic
              systems as mechanisms of control, and the discrimination,
              exclusion and disconnectedness faced by gig workers require
              further deliberation and policy response. A brief conclusion

Although the design of these platforms may foster unbalanced relationships, in this paper, we outline how freelancers and clients on the gig platform Upwork can leverage a network of alliances with external digital platforms to repossess their displaced agency within the gig economy. Building on 39 interviews with Upwork freelancers and clients, we found a dynamic ecosystem of digital platforms that facilitate gig work through and around the Upwork platform. We use actor-network theory to: 1) delineate Upwork's strategy to establish a comprehensive and isolated platform within the gig economy, 2) track human and nonhuman alliances that run counter to Upwork's system design and control mechanisms, and 3) capture the existence of a larger ecosystem of external digital platforms that undergird online freelancing. This work explicates the tensions that Upwork users face, and also illustrates the multiplicity of actors that create alliances to work with, through, around, and against the platform's algorithmic management.},

  abstract  = "This study examines gender segregation in the context of the
               so-called gig economy. In particular, it explores the role that
               stereotypes about male and female occupations play in sorting
               men and women into different jobs in an online freelance
               marketplace. The findings suggest that gender stereotypes are
               particularly salient in online hiring because employers
               typically contract for short-term, relatively low-value jobs
               based on limited information about job applicants. These
               conditions trigger the use of cognitive shortcuts about
               intrinsic gender characteristics linked to different skills and
               occupations. The results corroborate that female candidates are
               less likely to be hired for male-typed jobs (e.g., software
               development) but more likely to be hired for female-typed jobs
               (e.g., writing and translation) than equally qualified male
               candidates. Further, the study investigates three mechanisms
               predicted to attenuate the female penalty in male-typed jobs.
               The penalty is found to be self-reinforcing, as it perpetuates
               gender imbalances in worker activity across job categories that

In theory, these sites offer workers the ability to earn money without the obligations and potential social biases associated with traditional employment frameworks. In this paper, we study whether two prominent online freelance marketplaces - TaskRabbit and Fiverr - are impacted by racial and gender bias. From these two platforms, we collect 13,500 worker profiles and gather information about workers' gender, race, customer reviews, ratings, and positions in search rankings. In both marketplaces, we find evidence of bias: we find that gender and race are significantly correlated with worker evaluations, which could harm the employment opportunities afforded to the workers. We hope that our study fuels more research on the presence and implications of discrimination in online environments.},

               of regulating gig work through alternative regulatory
               frameworks, such as via competition and consumer laws. In part,
               this is because we generally understand this jurisdiction to be
               inherently anti-collective. However, significant changes within
               competition and consumer regulation in Australia challenge our
               pre-existing assumptions about the potential role and utility of
               this jurisdiction for protecting the rights of the
               self-employed, including gig workers. The High Court decision in
               Workpac v Rossato, emphasising contractual formalism, also
               impels some reconsideration of the utility of commercial law
               solutions given that there is unlikely to be any expansion of

               the provisions relating to unfair contract terms under the
               Australian Consumer Law, which are about to be substantially
               enhanced. Second, we explore a class exemption introduced by the
               Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which
               effectively permits collective bargaining by small businesses,
               including those engaged in platform work. This article will
               critically examine each of these developments and weigh up their

abstract = {{Debates on the gender pay gap have often focused on discrimination by employers, whether explicit or implicit, and the subsequent implications for men and women’s pay in the workplace. We use data from an online crowdworking platform, where workers’ sex is unknown to the employer, to assess whether there is a gender pay gap among crowdworkers. Despite employers not knowing the gender of the workers, the data nonetheless reveal a gender pay gap, with women earning on average 82\% of what men earned. Nevertheless, further analysis of the data reveal that the earnings gap between men and women can largely be explained by the individual characteristics of the worker (crowdworking experience and educational level) and women’s domestic responsibilities. Thus even in the absence of employer discrimination, domestic responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shouldered by women affect how they carry out their work and thus what they can earn. This finding points to a need to institute policies that address the sexual division of labour in the household, such as parental leave policies, as well as the public provision of childcare and elder care services to ease the burden of individual care responsibilities. In addition, crowdwork is currently not regulated by labour law which is affecting the overall level of earnings and working conditions of crowdworkers.}}

               online participation inequalities, and Internet use experiences
               and skills, shape the composition of online gig workers.
               Specifically, we analyze a unique survey data set from a
               national sample of 1512 U.S. adults that includes information
               about background attributes and behaviors, detailed measures of
               Internet experiences and skills, as well as questions about
               whether study participants had completed specific steps
               necessary to becoming a task worker on two prominent gig economy
               platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk and TaskRabbit. We use
               Bayesian regression to compare four stages of gig economy
               participation. Workers who participate in the gig economy tend
               to be younger, more highly educated, and more skilled Internet
               users. This implies that the gig economy increases labor market
               stratification and that digital participation inequalities
               compound labor inequalities.",

               begins by contextualizing the growth of freelancing in a
               transformation of capitalism to a mode of flexible accumulation.
               It is framed against neoliberal narratives about the creative
               economy, including promises of financial success and freedom
               from rigid Fordism. An exploration of the characteristics of

              have investigated the impact of individual socioeconomic position
              (SEP) on these disparities. Objectives: To determine the joint
              effects of SEP, race/ethnicity, and gender on the burden of
              COVID-19 mortality. A secondary objective was to determine
              whether differences in opportunities for remote work were
              correlated with COVID-19 death rates for sociodemographic groups.
              Design: Annual mortality study which used a special government
              tabulation of 2020 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by
              decedents' SEP (measured by educational attainment), gender, and
              race/ethnicity. Setting: United States in 2020. Participants:
              COVID-19 decedents aged 25 to 64 years old (n = 69,001).
              Exposures: Socioeconomic position (low, intermediate, and high),
              race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Black, Asian, Indigenous, multiracial,
              and non-Hispanic white), and gender (women and men). Detailed
              census data on occupations held by adults in 2020 in each of the
              36 sociodemographic groups studied were used to quantify the
              possibility of remote work for each group. Main Outcomes and
              Measures: Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates for 36
              sociodemographic groups. Disparities were quantified by relative
              risks and 95\% confidence intervals. High-SEP adults were the
              (low-risk) referent group for all relative risk calculations.
              Results: A higher proportion of Hispanics, Blacks, and Indigenous
              people were in a low SEP in 2020, compared with whites. COVID-19
              mortality was five times higher for low vs. high-SEP adults (72.2
              vs. 14.6 deaths per 100,000, RR = 4.94, 95\% CI 4.82-5.05). The
              joint detriments of low SEP, Hispanic ethnicity, and male gender
              resulted in a COVID-19 death rate which was over 27 times higher
              (178.0 vs. 6.5 deaths/100,000, RR = 27.4, 95\% CI 25.9-28.9) for
              low-SEP Hispanic men vs. high-SEP white women. In regression
              modeling, percent of the labor force in never remote jobs
              explained 72\% of the variance in COVID-19 death rates.
              Conclusions and Relevance: SARS-CoV-2 infection control efforts
              should prioritize low-SEP adults (i.e., the working class),
              particularly the majority with ``never remote'' jobs
              characterized by inflexible and unsafe working conditions (i.e.,
              blue collar, service, and retail sales workers).",

  abstract  = "Popular media suggests that technological advancement will
               continue to have a dramatic effect on work, but it is difficult
               to distinguish between the hype surrounding this and the actual
               potential impacts. This study examines what the evidence is in
               relation to the impact of emerging technologies on work and the
               role of the human resource (HR) function in helping employees
               and organisations to navigate these changes. Evidence suggests
               that the latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence
               and robotics, are being employed by organisations to automate
               simple and repetitive tasks as well as to make complex decisions
               quickly and more accurately via predictive algorithms. In
               addition, emerging technologies are increasingly being used to
               support the implementation of more flexible working practices
               such as virtual work and gig work. However, this will present a
               number of challenges for HR professionals, who will need to help
               employees to update their skills to compete in the future world
               of work, and to find ways to address the possible negative

               for normal causation (?Does job insecurity influence
               outcomes??), reversed causation (?Do specific outcomes predict
               job insecurity??), and reciprocal causation. We also review the
               various theories used to develop the hypotheses and whether
               theory has been used at all.MethodScientific and scholarly
               databases were searched to find all existing articles. We found
               57 longitudinal studies published since 1987 in a variety of
               countries throughout the world. All articles were summarised in
               an encompassing table.ResultsThe results show strong evidence
               for normal causation, in which job insecurity influences both
               psychological well?being and somatic health over time. The
               results were somewhat dependent on the type of outcome variable
               analysed, with clear evidence regarding exhaustion (burnout),
               general mental/psychological well?being, self?rated health, and
               a variety of somatic complaints. For aspects such as job
               satisfaction, work engagement, and psychosomatic complaints, the

              known as physical gig works (workers need to carry out tasks

  author    = "Benson, Alan and Sojourner, Aaron and Umyarov, Akhmed",
  abstract  = "Just as employers face uncertainty when hiring workers, workers
               also face uncertainty when accepting employment, and bad
               employers may opportunistically depart from expectations, norms,
               and laws. However, prior research in economics and information
               sciences has focused sharply on the employer?s problem of
               identifying good workers rather than vice versa. This issue is
               especially pronounced in markets for gig work, including online
               labor markets, in which platforms are developing strategies to
               help workers identify good employers. We build a theoretical
               model for the value of such reputation systems and test its
               predictions on Amazon Mechanical Turk, on which employers may
               decline to pay workers while keeping their work product and
               workers protect themselves using third-party reputation systems,
               such as Turkopticon. We find that (1) in an experiment on worker
               arrival, a good reputation allows employers to operate more
               quickly and on a larger scale without loss to quality; (2) in an
               experimental audit of employers, working for good-reputation
               employers pays 40\% higher effective wages because of faster
               completion times and lower likelihoods of rejection; and (3)
               exploiting reputation system crashes, the reputation system is
               particularly important to small, good-reputation employers,
               which rely on the reputation system to compete for workers
               against more established employers. This is the first clean
               field evidence of the effects of employer reputation in any

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The ``gig'' economy connects consumers with
              contractors (or workers) through online platform businesses to
              perform tasks (or ``gigs''). This innovation in technology
              provides businesses and consumers access to low-cost, on-demand
              labour, but gig workers' experiences are more complex. They have
              access to very flexible, potentially autonomous work, but also
              deal with challenges caused by the nature of the work, its
              precariousness, and their relationships with the platform
              businesses. Workers in the Global North and South may also
              experience these challenges very differently. Based on our report
              ``Towards an Understanding of Canadian Workers in the Global Gig
              Economy'', we present a commentary on the implications of a
              globalized online platform labour market on the health of gig
              workers in Canada and globally. MAIN BODY: Based on our scoping
              review of peer and grey literature, we categorized gig worker
              vulnerabilities in three ways: 1) occupational vulnerabilities,
              2) precarity, and 3) platform-based vulnerabilities. Occupational
              vulnerabilities are connected to the work being performed (e.g.
              driving a car or computer work) and are not specific to platform
              labour. Precarity refers to the short-term, contingent nature of
              the work, characteristics that may be shared with other forms of
              work. Some examples of precariousness are lack of health
              insurance, collective bargaining, or career training and
              promotion. Finally, platform-based vulnerabilities are particular
              to the way platform labour is structured. These vulnerabilities
              include worker misclassification, information asymmetries, and
              the culture of surveillance. We suggest that, together, these
              vulnerabilities challenge gig workers' right to health.
              CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the experience of gig workers around
              the world must be understood in the context of neoliberalism,
              which has increased both the globalization and precaritization of
              work. While gig workers share some vulnerabilities, which have
              important negative consequences on their health, with other
              workers, the platform-specific vulnerabilities of workers require
              further inquiry. In particular, the specific health and overall
              experience of gig workers in different regions of the world -
              with different labour policies and sociopolitical contexts for
              work - must be disentangled as workers in the Global North and
              South experience this work very differently.",

               computationally model worker well-being so that algorithmic
               management can be optimized for and assessed in terms of worker
               well-being? Toward this goal, we propose a participatory

               models---beliefs about fair resource allocation among multiple

               comparisons and ranking. As a case study, we evaluate our
               methods in the context of algorithmic work scheduling with 25
               shift workers and 3 managers. The findings show that workers
               expressed idiosyncratic work preference models and more uniform
               managerial fairness models, and the elicitation methods helped
               workers discover their preferences and gave them a sense of
