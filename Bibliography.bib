    abstract = { Many workers have been drawn to the gig economy by the promise of flexible, autonomous work, but scholars have highlighted how independent working arrangements also come with the drawbacks of precarity. Digital platforms appear to provide an alternative to certain aspects of precarity by helping workers find work consistently and securely. However, these platforms also introduce their own demands and constraints. Drawing on 20 interviews with online freelancers, 19 interviews with corresponding clients and a first-hand walkthrough of the Upwork platform, we identify critical literacies (what we call gig literacies), which are emerging around online freelancing. We find that gig workers must adapt their skills and work strategies in order to leverage platforms creatively and productively, and as a component of their ‘personal holding environment’. This involves not only using the resources provided by the platform effectively, but also negotiating or working around its imposed structures and control mechanisms. }

abstract = {This paper addresses calls for more research on privacy in the gig economy across a range of work platforms. To understand privacy risks, behaviors, and consequences from the perspective of workers, we analyzed workers’ posts about privacy and surveillance from 12 Reddit forums representing four main types of work (crowdwork, freelancing, ridesharing, and delivery). We found that workers perceive both platform companies and customers as sources of unnecessary and opaque data collection and surveillance that can threaten their privacy, safety, and economic outcomes. Workers also engage in many risk mitigation strategies, including self-protective surveillance behaviors such as video recording themselves and customers, as a costly but necessary response to power imbalances created by surveillance. Based on our multi-platform analysis, we present a guiding set of questions that workers, designers, and researchers can use to assess the privacy implications of current and future gig work platforms.},

abstract = {Online freelancer marketplaces offer workers the flexibility and control they desire. However, workers also struggle with the uncertainty resulting from these benefits. In traditional brick-and-mortar workplaces, workers who experience uncertainty during specific phases of their assimilation into a new role or organization engage in information-seeking behaviors. Understanding these phases of heightened uncertainty helps organizations better cater to workers' informational needs e.g. through mentorship programs. While understanding the uncertainty that online workers experience as they assimilate into their career is critical to understanding online workers' needs, such an understanding is currently severely limited. thus, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 online freelancers to investigate critical events that contribute to uncertainty early in their online careers. We situate these critical events within the context of organizational assimilation, and how participants employ diverse information-seeking tactics.},

abstract = {Information asymmetries create extractive, often harmful relationships between platform workers (e.g., Uber or Deliveroo drivers) and their algorithmic managers. Recent HCI studies have put forward more equitable platform designs but leave open questions about the social and technical infrastructures required to support them without the cooperation of platforms. We conducted a participatory design study in which platform workers deconstructed and re-imagined Uber’s schema for driver data. We analyzed the data structures and social institutions participants proposed, focusing on the stakeholders, roles, and strategies for mitigating conflicting interests of privacy, personal agency, and utility. Using critical theory, we reflected on the capability of participatory design to generate bottom-up collective data infrastructures. Based on the plurality of alternative institutions participants produced and their aptitude to navigate data stewardship decisions, we propose user-configurable tools for lightweight data institution building, as an alternative to redesigning existing platforms or delegating control to centralized trusts.},

    abstract = { This article evaluates the job quality of work in the remote gig economy. Such work consists of the remote provision of a wide variety of digital services mediated by online labour platforms. Focusing on workers in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the article draws on semi-structured interviews in six countries (N = 107) and a cross-regional survey (N = 679) to detail the manner in which remote gig work is shaped by platform-based algorithmic control. Despite varying country contexts and types of work, we show that algorithmic control is central to the operation of online labour platforms. Algorithmic management techniques tend to offer workers high levels of flexibility, autonomy, task variety and complexity. However, these mechanisms of control can also result in low pay, social isolation, working unsocial and irregular hours, overwork, sleep deprivation and exhaustion. }

This article reviews the extent of this type of work in Australia, and its main characteristics. It then considers the applicability of existing employment regulations to these ‘gig’ jobs, citing both Australian and international legislation and case law. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the scope of traditional regulations, minimum standards and remedies in the realm of irregular digitally mediated work. Regulators and policymakers should consider how to strengthen and expand the regulatory framework governing gig work. The article notes five major options in this regard: enforcement of existing laws; clarifying or expanding definitions of ‘employment’; creating a new category of ‘independent worker’; creating rights for ‘workers’, not employees; and reconsidering the concept of an ‘employer’. We review the pros and cons of these approaches and urge regulators to be creative and ambitious in better protecting the minimum standards and conditions of workers in these situations. }

Our findings suggest hiring biases against Black workers and less attractive workers, and preferences towards Asian workers, female workers and more attractive workers. We also show that certain UI designs, including provision of candidates' information at the individual level and reducing the number of choices, can significantly reduce discrimination. However, provision of candidate's information at the subgroup level can increase discrimination. The results have practical implications for designing better online freelance marketplaces.},

abstract = {{Enterprises in low‐resource contexts often rely on bricolage (i.e., making do by applying resources at hand to new problems). However, bricolage has traditionally been regarded as a way to temporarily get by, potentially constraining growth if continued over time. This has been explained by factors such as limited development of learning competencies. Surprisingly, we encountered a social organization appearing to use bricolage to scale extensively into a variety of locations. This puzzling observation prompted our research question: Can bricolage be scaled, and if so, how and why? We embarked on a process study of this organization, leading to a novel conceptual model of scaling bricolage: as a low‐cost replication process of heuristics, enabling fit with a diversity of local environments, as well as cross‐unit learning. How do organizations emerge, survive, and scale in resource‐scarce environments? Traditional scaling models tend to rely on considerable financial resources and companies often struggle to adjust to diverse contexts. In contrast, we identified and studied an organization in Sub‐Saharan Africa that we argue used simple rules to scale bricolage—making the best out of what is at hand—successfully in diverse low‐resource contexts. Our paper provides a novel conceptual model of scaling bricolage: a low‐cost replication process of heuristics, enabling fit with a diversity of local environments, as well as cross‐unit innovation and learning.}},

We propose the effect of workers’ use of the direct messaging system on employers’ hiring decisions and conceptualize the information role of direct messaging. To empirically evaluate the information role of the direct messaging system, we leverage data on the direct messaging activities between workers and employers across more than 470,000 job applications on a leading online labor market. We report evidence that direct messaging with a prospective employer increases a worker’s probability of being hired by 8.9\%. However, the degree to which workers benefit from direct messaging is heterogeneous, and the effect amplifies for workers approaching employers from a position of disadvantage (lacking tenure or fit with the job) and attenuates as more workers attempt to message the same prospective employer. The effects also depend on message content. In particular, we find that the benefits of direct messaging for workers depend a great deal on the politeness of the workers, and this “politeness effect” depends on several contextual factors. The beneficial effects are amplified for lower-status workers (i.e., workers lacking tenure and job fit) and workers who share a common language with the employer. At the same time, the beneficial effects weaken in the presence of typographical errors. These findings provide important insights into when and what to message to achieve favorable hiring outcomes in online employment settings.}},

abstract = {{Female entrepreneurship is increasingly playing phenomenal roles in the economic growth of many countries. Several businesses employing many people and producing a lot of revenues are created and run by women. Many governments and international bodies are promoting female entrepreneurship fervently especially in developing economies. However, the difficulty that women in resource-constrained economies face in accessing funding to start and grow their businesses makes going into entrepreneurship a wishful dream, thus pointing to low numbers of female ventures in developing countries. However, the phenomenal numbers of female entrepreneurs in certain developing regions such as West Africa present an intriguing situation. This study therefore sought to investigate the funding sources of female entrepreneurs in developing economies and how those sources are combined in funding businesses. Qualitative methods were employed for the study, collecting data through interviews and non-participant observations in two resource-constrained countries of West Africa—Ghana and Ivory Coast. We discovered that women entrepreneurs combined various resources from different sources to start and run businesses. These sources are made possible through their social capital. Prominent sources of funding are gifts/grants from friends, families, and well-wishers; personal savings; and interest-free loans. Few women accessed commercial loans but not until they have grown their businesses up to a certain stage. The study contributes to the social capital and entrepreneurial bricolage theories by extending them to entrepreneurial financing and female entrepreneurship in developing economies. It also adds to the studies questioning the well-publicized salvific role of microfinance in developing countries especially among the poor and vulnerable.}},

abstract = {{Live chat tools have emerged as a channel for fostering synchronous communication between sellers and buyers. The role of live chat in the e-commerce environment, however, is largely underexplored. Using granular data from Alibaba, we examine the effect of live chat on consumers’ purchase decisions. After controlling for the selection process that customers with high purchase intention are more likely to initiate live chat in the first place, we find that live chat can increase purchase probability of tablets by 15.99\%. We also investigate how the effect of live chat is moderated by existing information cues: product sales volume and seller feedback score. The substitutional or complementary patterns allow us to understand how live chat tools change the ways consumers evaluate product quality and seller credibility. We observe a substitutional effect of live chat on seller feedback score such that sellers with low feedback score benefit more from live chat conversations than sellers with high score. On the contrary, products with high past sales volume sell better after live chat, indicating a reinforcement effect. Such findings deepen our understanding of the difference between various information cues in electronic markets. As one of the first systematic studies to investigate live chat, our paper contributes to web trust conceptual frameworks with empirical analyses and sheds light on practical decisions faced by e-vendors and platform designers.}}

Three types of personalization strategies were proposed and operationalized in a simulated banking setting. Evaluations of service encounters that differed in the degree and type of personalization employed indicate that personalization is not a unitary phenomenon and must be approached carefully in the context of service design.}},

ANOVA results supported the hypotheses for individual students and dyads; however, the advisor varied the timing of her messages to harmonize with the students' preferred temporal styles. These findings suggest that individuals' temporal consistency with themselves may be disrupted if they accommodate to others; advisors may be especially likely to do this. A correlation was also found between number of characters and seconds per message across sessions, on the basis of which we posit an overall temporal profile for dyadic IM. Implications of the findings are discussed for online advising, instruction, and system design.}},

abstract = {{Employers in an online labor market often pursue workers with little capacity to take on more work. The pursuit of low-capacity workers is consequential, as these workers are more likely to reject employer inquires, causing a reduction in the probability a job opening is ultimately filled. In an attempt to shift more employer attention to workers with greater capacity, the market-designing platform introduced a new signaling feature into the market. It was effective, in that when a worker signaled having high capacity, he or she received more invitations from employers, rejected a smaller fraction of those invitations, quoted a lower price to do the work, and was more likely to be hired. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the signaling feature alone could increase market surplus by as much as 6\%, both by increasing the number of matches formed and by helping to allocate projects to workers with lower costs.}}

We then explore and propose to distinguish two forms of collective bricolage—familiar and convention-based—depending on the type of interaction and the nature of the conventions employed. Finally, we highlight the tension between ideal-typical bricolage and general organizational norms and standards, and discuss both the bricoleur’s legitimacy and how a bricolage-based arrangement might be embedded into an organizational context.}},

    abstract = { Uber, the ride-sharing company launched in 2010, has grown at an exponential rate. Using both survey and administrative data, the authors provide the first comprehensive analysis of the labor market for Uber’s driver-partners. Drivers appear to be attracted to the Uber platform largely because of the flexibility it offers, the level of compensation, and the fact that earnings per hour do not vary much based on the number of hours worked. Uber’s driver-partners are more similar in terms of their age and education to the general workforce than to taxi drivers and chauffeurs. Most of Uber’s driver-partners had full- or part-time employment before joining Uber, and many continue in those positions after starting to drive with the Uber platform, which makes the flexibility to set their own hours especially valuable. Drivers often cite the desire to smooth fluctuations in their income as one of their reasons for partnering with Uber. }

               increasingly complex value chain. To achieve operational

In this provocation piece, we debate the obstructions to and potential ways to promote boundaryless careers in the gig economy, which—despite appearing on the surface to offer suitable conditions for boundaryless careers—suffers from numerous conditions that hinder such careers. Thus, boundaryless careers in the gig economy could be an oxymoron. In particular, we conjecture that intraorganisational and interorganisational career boundaries restrict gig workers' development of relevant career competencies and thus limit their mobility. We then put forward the notion that we have to consider moving away from traditional, employer‐centric human resource management and introduce new forms of network‐based and self‐organised human resource management practices (in the form of collaborative communities of practice) in order to diminish these boundaries.}},

We report evidence that 1) DC employers are less likely to hire LDC compared to DC workers even after controlling for a wide range of observables, 2) workers with standardized and verified work history information are more likely to be hired, and 3) information on verified work history disproportionately benefits LDC contractors. The LDC premium also applies to additional outcomes including wage bids, obtaining an interview, and being shortlisted. In addition, the evidence suggests that informational limits to trade may be addressed through a variety of market design approaches; for instance, an online monitoring tool substitutes for verified work history information.}

               greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation.Only by radically

title={An Uber Ambivalence: Employee Status, Worker Perspectives, \& Regulation in the Gig Economy}, DOI={10.2139/ssrn.3488009}, abstractNote={This article uses ethnographic research on gig worker advocacy groups in California to make sense of an apparent paradox. Extant survey research finds that a majority of Uber/Lyft drivers in the U.S. do not want to be employees. And yet, drivers and gig worker groups aggressively advocated to pass AB5, an internationally heralded bill in California that makes it very likely that they are considered employees under state law. I argue that the paradoxes embodied in the perspectives of workers in my research can be theorized as attitudinal ambivalence. This ambivalence toward employee status was informed both by their relative powerlessness in relation to gig companies and by the uncertainties and insecurities specific to app-based gig work. Overwhelmingly, drivers both wanted employee benefits and feared how the companies might behave as an employer. Rather than re-shape employment laws and restrict worker benefits to accommodate the policy prescriptions of app-enabled gig companies, regulators may use these research findings to expand the benefits available through the traditional employment regime.}, journal={SSRN Electronic Journal}, author={Dubal, Veena }, year={2019} }

               persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI
               interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable

Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1)&nbsp;divergent perspectives on fairness, 2)&nbsp;the accuracy of AI, 3)&nbsp;the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4)&nbsp;the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5)&nbsp;the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity.

               arguing that Uber?s main innovation is not its app, but the
               creation of part-time vs. full-time drivers. This durational
               divide reproduces familiar hierarchies of race, gender, and

The paper illustrates the argument through the case of Turkopticon, originally an activist tool for workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), built by the authors and maintained since 2009. The paper analyzes public depictions of Turkopticon which cast designers as creative innovators and AMT workers as without agency or capacity to change their situation. We argue that designers' elevated status as workers in knowledge economies can have practical consequences for the politics of their design work. We explain the consequences of this status for Turkopticon and how we adapted our approach in response over the long term. We argue for analyses of power in design work that account for and develop counters to hegemonic beliefs and practices about design as high-status labor.},

abstract = {Attention-management tools can restrict online communication, but may cause collateral damage to their users’ fulfillment of communication expectations. This paper explores the idea of integrating attention management into instant messaging (IM), by 1) disclosing restriction status via an online status indicator (OSI) to manage contacts’ expectations, and 2) imposing communication limits to reduce communication distraction. We used a speed-dating design method to allow 43 participants to rapidly compare 48 types of OSI restriction in various conversational contexts. We identified two “tug-of-wars” that take place when attention management is integrated into IM apps: one between fulfilling one’s contacts’ expectations and protecting one’s own attention, and the other, between protecting one’s privacy and asserting the justifiability of using communication restrictions. We also highlighted the participants’ desire to be diplomatic for sustaining their positive images and maintaining relational connectedness. Finally, we provide design recommendations for integrating attention management into IM apps.},

abstract = {Many organizations have published principles intended to guide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems; however, their abstract nature makes them difficult to operationalize. Some organizations have therefore produced AI ethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific concepts, such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unless checklists are grounded in practitioners' needs, they may be misused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, we conducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners, focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklist and identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness checklists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists could provide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hoc processes and empowering individual advocates. We highlight aspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacy of AI fairness checklists, and suggest future design directions.},

We first surveyed 159 participants and elicited 33 unique SH-PPB practices, revealing that users heavily rely on ad hoc approaches at the physical layer (e.g., physical blocking, manual powering off). We also characterized the types of privacy concerns users wanted to address through SH-PPBs, the reasons preventing users from doing SH-PPBs, and privacy features they wished they had to support SH-PPBs. We then storyboarded 11 privacy protection concepts to explore opportunities to better support users’ needs, and asked another 227 participants to criticize and rank these design concepts. Among the 11 concepts, Privacy Diagnostics, which is similar to security diagnostics in anti-virus software, was far preferred over the rest. We also witnessed rich evidence of four important factors in designing SH-PPB tools, as users prefer (1) simple, (2) proactive, (3) preventative solutions that can (4) offer more control.},

Drawing from a mix of ethnographic observations, interviews, and participatory design encounters with frontline staff, we examine the experiences of workers in a waste management facility in the United States newly tasked with overseeing autonomous floor cleaning robots. To complement and extend managerial and engineering descriptions emphasizing the functionality and performance of these devices, we used recuperative approaches to re-center the socio-material realities of workers on-the-ground. For example, workers reported concerns on the safety of the devices in congested areas and a need for more comprehensive training across all levels of the organization. This research seeks to expand the discourse on ethical AI by situating essential workers as a key source in developing best practices for deploying new technologies and evaluating pilot projects.},

As unemployment worsened, these gig platforms also emerged as key sources of paid work for gig workers, with some platforms promising an unusual degree of health and financial support for their gig workforce. Through semi-structured interviews, we examine how women beauty workers engaged with the infrastructural promise extended by home service gig platforms during the pandemic. While gig platforms promoted the potential of stable income and social security in the context of the Global South, we investigate the reality behind this image. We find that various breakdowns, from miscommunication around localized travel restrictions to limited platform helpline access, introduces day-to-day unpredictability for gig workers, hindering access to paid work as well as other platform extended benefits. We suggest that home service gig platforms actually serve as 'faux infrastructure,' in which the privatized logics work to enclose public value, while pushing the burden of access onto gig workers who must perform additional, often unpaid labors, in order to fill last-mile service gaps.},

In this study, we propose that social sensing could address bottlenecks in worker’s awareness, interpretation of the informatics, and subsequent behavioral change. We conducted a four-week technology probe study by recruiting flexible long-hour professional drivers (Taxi and Uber drivers) and their significant others to use a social sensing prototype which collects data from the drivers and shares it with their partners as well as incorporates partners’ observations. We interviewed them before and after the probe study and found that while technological sensing was able to increase drivers’ awareness of their well-being status and intention to modify behaviors. The “social sensing” design was able to further shape such awareness or intention into action, highlighting the potential of using the sociotechnical approach in promoting work-life balance among long-hour workers.},

Recent scholarship in HCI and design has analyzed the ways collaborative design engagements, such as PD situated in the design workshop can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we argue that PD as instantiated in the design workshop is very much an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions among underserved populations. Based on two series of community-based PD workshops with underserved populations in the U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a more equitable PD approach: historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD workshop within HCI and re-center the focus of design on individuals who are historically underserved.},

While studies have reported that gig workers face bias, harassment, and a gender pay gap, we have limited understanding of women’s perspectives of these issues and their coping mechanisms. We interviewed 20 women gig workers to hear their unique experiences with these challenges. We found that gig platforms are gender-agnostic, meaning they do not acknowledge women’s experiences and the value they bring. By not enforcing anti-harassment policies in design, gig platforms also leave women workers vulnerable to bias and harassment. Due to the lack of support for immediate actions and in fear of losing access to work, women workers “brush off” harassment. In addition, the platforms’ dispatching and recommendation mechanisms do not acknowledge women’s contributions in perceived safety for customers and social support for peer workers.},

Through in-depth interviews with 19 beauty workers on on-demand home service platforms, we explore how the platformization of informal beauty work in India has ruptured dominant socio-cultural structures of control that have traditionally shaped women's mobility and access to work. This paper maps the ways in which women beauty gig workers experience and are impacted by algorithmic and bureaucratic management practices prevalent in the gig economy, in the context of home service platforms in Bangalore. We find that platform control impacts lives in myriad ways, beyond the conditions of work. Women workers negotiate their identities and sense of agency through the visibility afforded by platform control mechanisms. Yet, despite these subversions, being on a platform does not fundamentally change the socio-cultural logic that restricts women's lives in India. These mechanisms work to entrench power asymmetries between customers and workers, as well as maintain them between the platform and the worker.},

While women in online labor marketplaces earn about as much overall as men, women set lower bill rates suggesting gender differences in pricing strategies. In this study, we surveyed 392 freelancers in the United States (US) on the popular marketplace platform, Upwork, to understand strategies used to set hourly bill rates. We did not find gender differences in pricing strategies that were significantly related to bill rate. Instead, we found that other factors, such as full-time freelancer status and level of self-esteem, may help explain gender differences in bill rates. To better support equity and fairness in the growing gig economy, CHI researchers must identify, assess, and address the complex interaction between societal conditions in online labor markets.},

abstract = {We study how the ratings people receive on online labor platforms are influenced by their performance, gender, their rater's gender, and displayed ratings from other raters. We conducted a deception study in which participants collaborated on a task with a pair of simulated workers, who varied in gender and performance level, and then rated their performance. When the performance of paired workers was similar, low-performing females were rated lower than their male counterparts. Where there was a clear performance difference between paired workers, low-performing females were preferred over a similarly-performing male peer. Furthermore, displaying an average rating from other raters made ratings more extreme, resulting in high performing workers receiving significantly higher ratings and low performers lower ratings compared to when average ratings were absent. This work contributes an empirical understanding of when biases in ratings manifest, and offers recommendations for how online work platforms can counter these biases.},

abstract = {What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: "should I calculate IRR?" Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research.},

One way to expand AI design is by centering stakeholders in the design process. We conduct co-design sessions with gig workers to explore the design of gig worker-centered tools as informed by their driving patterns, decisions, and personal contexts. Using workers’ own data as well as city-level data, we create probes—interactive data visuals—that participants explore to surface the well-being and positionalities that shape their work strategies. We describe participant insights and corresponding AI design considerations surfaced from data probes about: 1) workers’ well-being trade-offs and positionality constraints, 2) factors that impact well-being beyond those in the data probes, and 3) instances of unfair algorithmic management. We discuss the implications for designing data probes and using them to elevate worker-centered AI design as well as for worker advocacy.},

  abstract = "A breadth of literature has examined how gig workers use online
              forums. The past literature focuses primarily on how gig workers
              for mainstream corporate platforms leverage forums. Yet,
              marginalization, stigma, censorship, and criminalization all
              shape how people, including gig workers, use digital technology.
              In this work, we seek to take a first step toward understanding
              how marginalized, stigmatized, digitally censored, and in some
              cases criminalized gig workers leverage the affordances of online
              public forums to build community and increase their welfare. To
              do so, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 4,000 posts and
              25,851 comments shared over four months in a large online public
              forum used by sex workers for peer support. Sex workers sit at
              the intersection of multiple marginalized communities, and thus
              offer a lens into the broader use of forums by marginalized labor
              communities. Our findings offer insight into how these workers
              use moderation to preserve their safety and community. Further,

  abstract = "The gig economy is a phenomenon that is rapidly expanding,
              redefining the nature of work and contributing to a significant
              change in how contemporary economies are organised. Its expansion
              is not unproblematic. This article provides a clear and
              systematic analysis of the main ethical challenges caused by the
              gig economy. Following a brief overview of the gig economy, its
              scope and scale, we map the key ethical problems that it gives
              rise to, as they are discussed in the relevant literature. We map
              them onto three categories: the new organisation of work (what is
              done), the new nature of work (how it is done), and the new
              status of workers (who does it). We then evaluate a recent
              initiative from the EU that seeks to address the challenges of
              the gig economy. The 2019 report of the European High-Level
              Expert Group on the Impact of the Digital Transformation on EU
              Labour Markets is a positive step in the right direction.
              However, we argue that ethical concerns relating to algorithmic
              systems as mechanisms of control, and the discrimination,
              exclusion and disconnectedness faced by gig workers require
              further deliberation and policy response. A brief conclusion
              completes the analysis. The appendix presents the methodology

During its early years, Etsy was seen as a champion of “handmade”, bringing visibility to crafts and providing economic value. This paper presents results of a qualitative study with 18 small online sellers of Etsy platform. Our study shows that Etsy’s sociotechnical design results in a high burden of invisible labor for sellers, including categories of labor not replicated by other online platforms. These new categories include negotiation and articulation work around defining and defending “handmade” products, understanding one’s intellectual property and how (and whether) to defend that IP elsewhere on the platform, understanding working of platform algorithms and adapting to changing platform regulations. Our findings provide new ways to frame the challenges faced by producers/sellers on emerging marketplace platforms.},

Building on 39 interviews with Upwork freelancers and clients, we found a dynamic ecosystem of digital platforms that facilitate gig work through and around the Upwork platform. We use actor-network theory to: 1) delineate Upwork's strategy to establish a comprehensive and isolated platform within the gig economy, 2) track human and nonhuman alliances that run counter to Upwork's system design and control mechanisms, and 3) capture the existence of a larger ecosystem of external digital platforms that undergird online freelancing. This work explicates the tensions that Upwork users face, and also illustrates the multiplicity of actors that create alliances to work with, through, around, and against the platform's algorithmic management.},

               so-called gig economy. In particular, it explores the role that
               stereotypes about male and female occupations play in sorting
               men and women into different jobs in an online freelance
               marketplace. The findings suggest that gender stereotypes are
               particularly salient in online hiring because employers
               typically contract for short-term, relatively low-value jobs
               based on limited information about job applicants. These
               conditions trigger the use of cognitive shortcuts about
               intrinsic gender characteristics linked to different skills and
               occupations. The results corroborate that female candidates are
               less likely to be hired for male-typed jobs (e.g., software
               development) but more likely to be hired for female-typed jobs
               (e.g., writing and translation) than equally qualified male
               candidates. Further, the study investigates three mechanisms
               predicted to attenuate the female penalty in male-typed jobs.
               The penalty is found to be self-reinforcing, as it perpetuates
               gender imbalances in worker activity across job categories that

But it is also possible that crowd work will fail to achieve its potential, focusing on assembly-line piecework. Can we foresee a future crowd workplace in which we would want our children to participate? This paper frames the major challenges that stand in the way of this goal. Drawing on theory from organizational behavior and distributed computing, as well as direct feedback from workers, we outline a framework that will enable crowd work that is complex, collaborative, and sustainable. The framework lays out research challenges in twelve major areas: workflow, task assignment, hierarchy, real-time response, synchronous collaboration, quality control, crowds guiding AIs, AIs guiding crowds, platforms, job design, reputation, and motivation.},

In theory, these sites offer workers the ability to earn money without the obligations and potential social biases associated with traditional employment frameworks. In this paper, we study whether two prominent online freelance marketplaces - TaskRabbit and Fiverr - are impacted by racial and gender bias. From these two platforms, we collect 13,500 worker profiles and gather information about workers' gender, race, customer reviews, ratings, and positions in search rankings. In both marketplaces, we find evidence of bias: we find that gender and race are significantly correlated with worker evaluations, which could harm the employment opportunities afforded to the workers. We hope that our study fuels more research on the presence and implications of discrimination in online environments.},

               time has been spent considering the advantages and disadvantages
               of regulating gig work through alternative regulatory
               frameworks, such as via competition and consumer laws. In part,
               this is because we generally understand this jurisdiction to be
               inherently anti-collective. However, significant changes within
               competition and consumer regulation in Australia challenge our
               pre-existing assumptions about the potential role and utility of
               this jurisdiction for protecting the rights of the
               self-employed, including gig workers. The High Court decision in
               Workpac v Rossato, emphasising contractual formalism, also
               impels some reconsideration of the utility of commercial law
               solutions given that there is unlikely to be any expansion of
               labour law protections any time soon. In this short paper, we

               the provisions relating to unfair contract terms under the
               Australian Consumer Law, which are about to be substantially
               enhanced. Second, we explore a class exemption introduced by the
               Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which
               effectively permits collective bargaining by small businesses,
               including those engaged in platform work. This article will

abstract = {{Debates on the gender pay gap have often focused on discrimination by employers, whether explicit or implicit, and the subsequent implications for men and women’s pay in the workplace. We use data from an online crowdworking platform, where workers’ sex is unknown to the employer, to assess whether there is a gender pay gap among crowdworkers. Despite employers not knowing the gender of the workers, the data nonetheless reveal a gender pay gap, with women earning on average 82\% of what men earned. Nevertheless, further analysis of the data reveal that the earnings gap between men and women can largely be explained by the individual characteristics of the worker (crowdworking experience and educational level) and women’s domestic responsibilities. Thus even in the absence of employer discrimination, domestic responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shouldered by women affect how they carry out their work and thus what they can earn. This finding points to a need to institute policies that address the sexual division of labour in the household, such as parental leave policies, as well as the public provision of childcare and elder care services to ease the burden of individual care responsibilities. In addition, crowdwork is currently not regulated by labour law which is affecting the overall level of earnings and working conditions of crowdworkers.}}

              rental room prices on Airbnb, we find that prices are strategic

              characteristics of the room, and the features of the
              neighborhood. The marketing implication is that consumers respond
              to the contents of online reviews, in addition to customer

              mortality have been previously documented. However, few studies
              have investigated the impact of individual socioeconomic position
              (SEP) on these disparities. Objectives: To determine the joint
              effects of SEP, race/ethnicity, and gender on the burden of
              COVID-19 mortality. A secondary objective was to determine
              whether differences in opportunities for remote work were
              correlated with COVID-19 death rates for sociodemographic groups.
              Design: Annual mortality study which used a special government
              tabulation of 2020 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by
              decedents' SEP (measured by educational attainment), gender, and
              race/ethnicity. Setting: United States in 2020. Participants:
              COVID-19 decedents aged 25 to 64 years old (n = 69,001).
              Exposures: Socioeconomic position (low, intermediate, and high),
              race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Black, Asian, Indigenous, multiracial,
              and non-Hispanic white), and gender (women and men). Detailed
              census data on occupations held by adults in 2020 in each of the
              36 sociodemographic groups studied were used to quantify the
              possibility of remote work for each group. Main Outcomes and
              Measures: Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates for 36
              sociodemographic groups. Disparities were quantified by relative
              risks and 95\% confidence intervals. High-SEP adults were the
              (low-risk) referent group for all relative risk calculations.
              Results: A higher proportion of Hispanics, Blacks, and Indigenous
              people were in a low SEP in 2020, compared with whites. COVID-19
              mortality was five times higher for low vs. high-SEP adults (72.2
              vs. 14.6 deaths per 100,000, RR = 4.94, 95\% CI 4.82-5.05). The
              joint detriments of low SEP, Hispanic ethnicity, and male gender
              resulted in a COVID-19 death rate which was over 27 times higher
              (178.0 vs. 6.5 deaths/100,000, RR = 27.4, 95\% CI 25.9-28.9) for
              low-SEP Hispanic men vs. high-SEP white women. In regression
              modeling, percent of the labor force in never remote jobs
              explained 72\% of the variance in COVID-19 death rates.
              Conclusions and Relevance: SARS-CoV-2 infection control efforts
              should prioritize low-SEP adults (i.e., the working class),
              particularly the majority with ``never remote'' jobs
              characterized by inflexible and unsafe working conditions (i.e.,
              blue collar, service, and retail sales workers).",

               job insecurity??), and reciprocal causation. We also review the
               various theories used to develop the hypotheses and whether
               theory has been used at all.MethodScientific and scholarly
               databases were searched to find all existing articles. We found
               57 longitudinal studies published since 1987 in a variety of
               countries throughout the world. All articles were summarised in
               an encompassing table.ResultsThe results show strong evidence
               for normal causation, in which job insecurity influences both
               psychological well?being and somatic health over time. The
               results were somewhat dependent on the type of outcome variable
               analysed, with clear evidence regarding exhaustion (burnout),
               general mental/psychological well?being, self?rated health, and
               a variety of somatic complaints. For aspects such as job
               satisfaction, work engagement, and psychosomatic complaints, the
               results suggested normal causation in one half to two thirds of

               predictions on Amazon Mechanical Turk, on which employers may
               decline to pay workers while keeping their work product and
               workers protect themselves using third-party reputation systems,
               such as Turkopticon. We find that (1) in an experiment on worker
               arrival, a good reputation allows employers to operate more
               quickly and on a larger scale without loss to quality; (2) in an
               experimental audit of employers, working for good-reputation
               employers pays 40\% higher effective wages because of faster
               completion times and lower likelihoods of rejection; and (3)
               exploiting reputation system crashes, the reputation system is
               particularly important to small, good-reputation employers,
               which rely on the reputation system to compete for workers
               against more established employers. This is the first clean
               field evidence of the effects of employer reputation in any
               labor market and is suggestive of the special role that
               reputation-diffusing technologies can play in promoting gig
               work, in which conventional labor and contract laws are

abstract = {The increased use of machine learning in recent years led to large volumes of data being manually labeled via crowdsourcing microtasks completed by humans. This brought about dehumanization effects, namely, when task requesters overlook the humans behind the task, leading to issues of ethics (e.g., unfair payment) and amplification of human biases, which are transferred into training data and affect machine learning in the real world. We propose a framework that allocates microtasks considering human factors of workers such as demographics and compensation. We deployed our framework to a popular crowdsourcing platform and conducted experiments with 1,919 workers collecting 160,345 human judgments. By routing microtasks to workers based on demographics and appropriate pay, our framework mitigates biases in the contributor sample and increases the hourly pay given to contributors. We discuss potential extensions and how it can promote transparency in crowdsourcing.},

               platform labor research to investigate how socio-psychological
               factors affect the mental well-being of platform workers and
               help them cope with the challenges of work. Based on a survey
               study of 500 food-delivery workers (?riders?) in China, we
               provide quantitative evidence of workers' ambivalent subjective
               experiences that complements the predominantly qualitative
               account in the extant literature. In particular, we assess the
               complex relationships between meaningfulness of work, autonomy
               at work, self-perceived competence, and workers' subjective
               well-being. Our data also show that the stress-buffering effect
               of social support mainly comes from the riders' familial contact
               and their online group chat with other workers. Overall, despite
               the well-documented precarity and stress in platform work, the
               riders in our sample appear to be able to mobilize inner and
               relational resources to achieve a relatively high-level mental

  abstract  = "Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to manage the
               workforce. Algorithmic management promises organizational
               efficiency, but often undermines worker well-being. How can we
               computationally model worker well-being so that algorithmic
               management can be optimized for and assessed in terms of worker
               well-being? Toward this goal, we propose a participatory
               approach for worker well-being models. We first define worker
               well-being models: Work preference models---preferences about
               work and working conditions, and managerial fairness
               models---beliefs about fair resource allocation among multiple
               workers. We then propose elicitation methods to enable workers
               to build their own well-being models leveraging pairwise
               comparisons and ranking. As a case study, we evaluate our
               methods in the context of algorithmic work scheduling with 25
               shift workers and 3 managers. The findings show that workers
               expressed idiosyncratic work preference models and more uniform
               managerial fairness models, and the elicitation methods helped
               workers discover their preferences and gave them a sense of
               empowerment. Our work provides a method and initial evidence for
               enabling participatory algorithmic management for worker

This particularly disadvantages socially and economically marginalized job seekers who are already being pushed into lower-wage precarious work with increasing levels of job insecurity. While the number of employment support tools that match job seekers to employers has been growing, marginalized job seekers still significantly rely on physical employment centers that have a track record of supporting the specific needs associated with marginalization and economic constraints. We drew from prior HCI and CSCW literature uncovering the employment and technology-related challenges that marginalized job seekers face and from the Psychology of Working Theory to frame our research questions and results. To complement this prior work, we investigated how employment center staff work with marginalized job seekers and moderate factors to securing decent work. We found in an interview of 21 employment center staff--career advisors and business services coordinators--that they performed significant work to prepare and encourage marginalized job seekers in applying to positions, while also training employers to be more inclusive and open-minded. Career advisors worked directly with job seekers to connect them with external resources, provide encouragement, strategize long-term goals, and mitigate feelings of stigma. Business services coordinators worked directly with employers to prepare job positions and employee support programs. Drawing from the expertise of employment centers, we contribute a framework for designing employment support tools that better serve the needs of marginalized job seekers, and outline tangible design implications that complement the support these organizations provide.},

The platform, Nosh, provides an alternative to mainstream services, such as Doordash and Uber Eats, in several communities in the Western United States. We interviewed 28 stakeholders including restauranteurs, couriers, consumers, and platform administrators. Drawing on infrastructure literature, we learned that the platform is a patchwork of disparate technical systems held together by human intervention. Participants join this platform because they receive greater agency, financial security, and local support. We identify human intervention’s key role in making food delivery platform users feel respected. This study provides insights into the affordances, limitations, and possibilities of food delivery platforms designed to prioritize local contexts over transnational scales.},

author = {Stefano, Valerio De}, 
journal = {SSRN Electronic Journal}, 
doi = {10.2139/ssrn.2682602}, 
abstract = {{The so-called “gig-economy” has been growing exponentially in numbers and importance in recent years but its impact on labour rights has been largely overlooked. Forms of work in the “gig-economy” include “crowd work”, and “work-on-demand via apps”, under which the demand and supply of working activities is matched online or via mobile apps. These forms of work can provide a good match of job opportunities and allow flexible working schedules. However, they can also pave the way to a severe commodification of work. This paper discusses the implications of this commodification and advocates the full recognition of activities in the gig-economy as “work”. It shows how the gig-economy is not a separate silo of the economy and that is part of broader phenomena such as casualization and informalisation of work and the spread of non-standard forms of employment. It then analyses the risks associated to these activities with regard to Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, as they are defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and addresses the issue of misclassification of the employment status of workers in the gig-economy. Current relevant trends are thus examined, such as the emergence of forms of self-organisation of workers. Finally, some policy proposals are critically analysed, such as the possibility of creating an intermediate category of worker between “employee” and “independent contractor” to classify work in the gig-economy, and other tentative proposals are put forward such extension of fundamental labour rights to all workers irrespective of employment status, and recognition of the role of social partners in this respect, whilst avoiding temptations of hastened deregulation.}}

abstract = {In many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. However, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). In this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the United States (48.8\% women) on Upwork, a popular gig work platform. The median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74\% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. However, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. To better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities.},

This paper offers an analysis of Amazon Mechanical Turk, a popular human computation system, as a site of technically mediated worker-employer relations. We argue that human computation currently relies on worker invisibility. We then present Turkopticon, an activist system that allows workers to publicize and evaluate their relationships with employers. As a common infrastructure, Turkopticon also enables workers to engage one another in mutual aid. We conclude by discussing the potentials and challenges of sustaining activist technologies that intervene in large, existing socio-technical systems.},

However, many collective action efforts never succeed: while the web's affordances make it easy to gather, these same decentralizing characteristics impede any focus towards action. In this paper, we study challenges to collective action efforts through the lens of online labor by engaging with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. Through a year of ethnographic fieldwork, we sought to understand online workers' unique barriers to collective action. We then created Dynamo, a platform to support the Mechanical Turk community in forming publics around issues and then mobilizing. We found that collective action publics tread a precariously narrow path between the twin perils of stalling and friction, balancing with each step between losing momentum and flaring into acrimony. However, specially structured labor to maintain efforts' forward motion can help such publics take action.},

However, despite this rapid growth, we have a limited understanding of online freelancers' long-term experiences and evolution, or how online freelancing influences freelancers' broader career goals. To address this gap, we interviewed a set of online freelancers at two time periods, two and a half years apart. We found that long-term engagement with online freelancing involves a unique set of financial, emotional, relational, and reputational burdens that represent the overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career. We found that this overhead influenced online freelancers' participation and perceptions of online freelancing over time, as well as the strategies some freelancers employed to manage their careers. Our findings further highlight how online freelance platforms can afford unique career development opportunities over a longer period of time, including career exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training and reputation, and skills transfer. Based on our findings, we present policy and design implications to increase the sustainability and accessibility of online freelancing.},

Prior research in HCI has primarily focused on forms of gig work such as ride-sharing and microwork but has not addressed how freelancing platforms are disrupting high-skilled knowledge work. To understand freelancers’ perspectives on how these platforms are disrupting their work we have collected and thematically analysed 528 posts with 7499 comments from four relevant subforums on Reddit. The qualitative findings reveal tensions between wanting autonomy and control and the necessity of opportunities and convenience. Freelancing platforms are perceived as systems that present advantages to find clients, gain experience and mitigate precarity. However, these platforms constrain the control over their work that freelancers value. The paper contributes an improved understanding of freelance work, the role and potential for freelancing platforms in the knowledge-based gig economy, and directions for worker-centred design.},

However, aides' work is often unrecognized by the broader caregiving team despite being in demand and crucial to care---an invisibility reinforced by ill-suited technological tools. In order to understand the invisible work aides perform and its relationship to technology design, we interviewed 13 aides employed by home care agencies in New York City. These aides shared examples that demonstrated the intertwined nature of both types of invisible work (i.e., emotions- and systems-based) and expanded the sociological mechanisms of invisibility (i.e., sociocultural, sociolegal, sociospatial) to include the sociotechnical. Through these findings, we investigate the opportunities, tensions, and challenges that could inform the design of tools created for these important, but often overlooked, frontline caregivers.},

Understanding disabled gig workers' experiences is a vital step toward developing inclusive and equitable labor platforms. Through interviews with 24 disabled gig workers and observational fieldwork, we present a rich, in-depth picture of the opportunities and challenges presented by four main types of gig work (ridesharing, delivery, crowdwork, and freelancing) for workers with a wide range of disabilities. We identify a key tension: gig work can be a vital source of needed income for workers who have been excluded from traditional workplaces, but at the same time, the structure of gig platforms present workers with a host of new disability-related challenges, including around algorithmic control and performance evaluation. We discuss how this tension plays out in terms of how workers engage in gig work and protect themselves from risk. We also call attention to how many workers can face complicated, intersectional challenges based on multiple marginalized identities in addition to disability, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Our work contributes to research on the gig economy by centering the perspectives of workers who are marginalized based on disability and other identities. We show how workers face several penalties based on disability, including shouldering extensive invisible labor to mitigate the challenges they face. Based on our interviews, we suggest several ways that on-demand labor platforms can be designed to be more inclusive of disability, including how to improve the accessibility of various tasks while mitigating the discrimination and negative interactions faced by disabled workers.},

 @article{care_advocacy, title={Data Advocacy for Visibility of Home Care Workers}, DOI={10.1145/3584931.3608922}, abstractNote={Technology solutions have been proposed to address the “care gap” that the United States has been facing due to the increasing demand for home and community based services that far exceeds the supply of caregivers. However, these technology solutions do not fully address the crux of the crisis—the poor working conditions of home care workers (HCWs). Rather, these technology solutions further burden, invisibilize, and surveil workers. My research challenges this dynamic by proposing the design of technology that can be used to advocate for the workers, amplifying their voices and highlighting their work. In this paper, I describe the three phases of my research where I: (1) examine the relationship between visibility and technology, (2) explore different design approaches to see how technology could complicate questions of visibility, and (3) build and deploy a system to evaluate how data could be used for advocacy. Helping workers collect and share data could build awareness and solidarity, expose employer violations and uncompensated work, and challenge existing narratives of care.}, journal={Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing}, author={Ming, Joy}, year={2023}, pages={444–447} }

abstract = { Algorithmic management is used to govern digital work platforms such as Upwork or Fiverr. However, algorithmic decision-making is often non-transparent and rapidly evolving, forcing workers to constantly adapt their behavior. Extant research focuses on how workers experience algorithmic management, while often disregarding the agency that workers exert in dealing with algorithmic management. Following a sociomateriality perspective, we investigate the practices that workers develop to comply with (assumed) mechanisms of algorithmic management on digital work platforms. Based on a systematic content analysis of 12,294 scraped comments from an online community of digital freelancers, we show how workers adopt direct and indirect “anticipatory compliance practices”, such as undervaluing their own work, staying under the radar, curtailing their outreach to clients and keeping emotions in check, in order to ensure their continued participation on the platform, which takes on the role of a shadow employer. Our study contributes to research on algorithmic management by (1) showing how workers adopt practices aimed at “pacifying” the platform algorithm; (2) outlining how workers engage in extra work; (3) showing how workers co-construct the power of algorithms through their anticipatory compliance practices. }
